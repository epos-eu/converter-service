These resources (schemas and payloads) are just a snapshot copies from the native Java plug-ins. 
The purpose of these tests is to test the common schema validation framework (which could be used from the application or from the individual
 native Java plug-ins) and not the specific schemas/payloads. 
 I.e. the resources used in these test do not need to be kept in sync with those of their originating plug-in project.
