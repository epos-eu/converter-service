For transformations involving 'FSDM Station XML' the full schema is used (https://www.fdsn.org/xml/station/) [fdsn-station-1.0.xsd]
	The disadvantage of this is that our plugin code is only written to support specific transformations so the schema will not 
	be as tight to the plugin code as it could be.

	Now undecided as to whether tighening this should be a TODO in case the TCS(s) flex their payload structure in the future.
