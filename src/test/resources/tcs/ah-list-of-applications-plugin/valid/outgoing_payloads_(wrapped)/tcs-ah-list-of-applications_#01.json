					"description": "\u003cp\u003eScientific Background\u003cbr/\u003e\nThere is no consensus on the a-priori distance-time-size patterns to be selected to relate a given earthquake to a given georesource-reservoir exploitation (e.g. Gupta, 2002, Klose 2013, NRC, 2013). From the one hand, some authors suggest, on observational bases, a 30-50 km distance and 10-20 years times from reservoir to relate an earthquake to a given geo-resource « reservoir » (e.g. for a review Gupta, 2002, Klose 2013). These a-priori space-time windows question on any of the physics processes that may drive a constant triggering distance to an extended loading source (i.e. not a point source such as a lake surface, or hydrocarbon reservoir).\u003cbr/\u003e\nFrom the other hand, there are evidences that the use of the absolute distance captures earthquake-earthquake triggering patterns (as aftershock-mainshock pair) that hide the key properties of the event interactions (e.g. Bak et al 2002; Parsons and Velasco, 2009, Tahir et al., 2012, Tahir and Grasso, 2015, de Arcangelis et al 2016).  For tectonic earthquake interactions, the size of the triggering zone is mapped by static stress perturbation. This later is estimated to be in the 1-3 L ranges for aftershocks triggering (Parsons and Velasco 2009; Tahir et al. 2012; Tahir and Grasso, 2015). For the tectonic earthquake analysis (L) is the mainshock fault length as derived from magnitude scale (e.g. Wells and Coppersmith, 1994). In order to mimics the earthquake interaction analysis, we choose  (Lr) the reservoir length as the equivalent of the mainshock fault length, the characteristic dimension that drives the stress change pattern induced by georesource productions (e.g. Gupta and Rastogi 1976, Bell and Nur, 1978, Roeloffs, 1988; Segall et al. 1994,  Deng et al., 2010).\u003cbr/\u003e\nThis way, in the episodes and applications we uploaded on the platform, we propose to analyse the triggering patterns around geo-resource production using 1-3-10Lr normalized distances to the georesource “reservoir”, respectively.  Lr is the characteristic dimension the user defines from the geometry of the georesource production the user work with. Furthermore the rate of aftershocks, whatever the definition, provides information on the proportion of events directly driven by the geo-resource production and the one that are triggered by others earthquake (Helmstetter et al. 2002,  Traversa et Grasso 2008,  De Arcangelis et al. 2016)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp/\u003eApplication objectives\u003cbr/\u003e\nAnthropogenic seismicity rate and magnitude are analyzed using superposed epoch to extract mean field patterns that are more robust than a single serie. This application analyse aftershocks sequence in the  1-3L near field distances  from the “reservoir”. L is a proxy for georesource dimension, being mine gallery width, reservoir length , etc...\u003cbr/\u003e\nInput data are time series from seismicity catalogue.\u003cbr/\u003e\nThis application is important to quantify the mean field pattern of several aftershocks to be compared with regional  tectonic patterns\u003cbr/\u003e\nOutputs as aftershock rate over time may be compared to outputs of application “Earthquake interactions - mainshock scale”\u003c/p\u003e",

					"description": "\u003cp\u003eScientific Background\u003cbr/\u003e\nThere is no consensus on the a-priori distance-time-size patterns to be selected to relate a given earthquake to a given georesource-reservoir exploitation (e.g. Gupta, 2002, Klose 2013, NRC, 2013). From the one hand, some authors suggest, on observational bases, a 30-50 km distance and 10-20 years times from reservoir to relate an earthquake to a given geo-resource « reservoir » (e.g. for a review Gupta, 2002, Klose 2013). These a-priori space-time windows question on any of the physics processes that may drive a constant triggering distance to an extended loading source (i.e. not a point source such as a lake surface, or hydrocarbon reservoir).\u003cbr/\u003e\nFrom the other hand, there are evidences that the use of the absolute distance captures earthquake-earthquake triggering patterns (as aftershock-mainshock pair) that hide the key properties of the event interactions (e.g. Bak et al 2002; Parsons and Velasco, 2009, Tahir et al., 2012, Tahir and Grasso, 2015, de Arcangelis et al 2016).  For tectonic earthquake interactions, the size of the triggering zone is mapped by static stress perturbation. This later is estimated to be in the 1-3 L ranges for aftershocks triggering (Parsons and Velasco 2009; Tahir et al. 2012; Tahir and Grasso, 2015). For the tectonic earthquake analysis (L) is the mainshock fault length as derived from magnitude scale (e.g. Wells and Coppersmith, 1994). In order to mimics the earthquake interaction analysis, we choose  (Lr) the reservoir length as the equivalent of the mainshock fault length, the characteristic dimension that drives the stress change pattern induced by georesource productions (e.g. Gupta and Rastogi 1976, Bell and Nur, 1978, Roeloffs, 1988; Segall et al. 1994,  Deng et al., 2010).\u003cbr/\u003e\nThis way, in the episodes and applications we uploaded on the platform, we propose to analyse the triggering patterns around geo-resource production using 1-3-10Lr normalized distances to the georesource “reservoir”, respectively.  Lr is the characteristic dimension the user defines from the geometry of the georesource production the user work with. Furthermore the rate of aftershocks, whatever the definition, provides information on the proportion of events directly driven by the geo-resource production and the one that are triggered by others earthquake (Helmstetter et al. 2002,  Traversa et Grasso 2008,  De Arcangelis et al. 2016)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApplication objectives\u003cbr/\u003e\nAnthropogenic seismicity rate and magnitude are analyzed using superposed epochs to extract mean field patterns that are more robust than a single serie.

First, a characteristic function (CF; in this case, the STA/LTA ratio) is calculated at all the vertical-component seismograms from the selected stations. The user then define a volume likely containing the source(s), and a number of grid nodes along the two horizontal (NS-EW) and vertical coordinates for discretising this volume. For each grid node located at the arbitrary location (x,y,z), the predicted arrival times are calculated at all the stations, and the different CFs are time-shifted consequently. By stacking these time-shifted CFs one obtains a time-dependent Brightness function associated with that particular grid node. The procedure is iterated over all the grid nodes of the source volume; at the end of the process, the maximum (maxima) of the Brightness function will provide an estimate of the source location and origin time. The main advantage of this procedure is that it exploits waveform information (both arrival times and relative amplitudes) without the need of pre-assembled phase-picking data. The method, therefore, is particularly well-suited for emergent signals and/or for real-time applications. The technique has been largely inspired by the previous works from Kao and Shan (2004), Grigoli et al. (2013, 2014), Langet et al., (2014), to which the reader is referred for a more comprehensive description of the methodology.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe application parameters include: P-wave velocity of homogeneous model; coordinates of the corners of the volume where sources are sought; number of grid nodes for parameterizing the source volume; time window length for calculating the characteristic function; corner frequencies of band-pass filter; output type\u003c/p\u003e",
