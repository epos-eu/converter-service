Simple, minimal, payload declaring only 1 network entry with only 1 measurement from a particular station.

This content would have failed conversion on the Mapper (due to missing <Sender> element) but I believe this 
was incorrect behaviour - if we are basing what is valid content on the 'fsdn-station-1.0.xsd' schema.
